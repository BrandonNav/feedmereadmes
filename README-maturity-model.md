## README Maturity Model

### Level One: "The Code is the Documentation"
- No/almost no README text of any sort.
- No installation, configuration, running details.
- No developer documentation.
- No complimentary files, such as contributor guidelines.
- No build status information, such that the reader will not gain much insight into the project's current state.
- No indication about average response time to issues and/or pull requests.
- No badges to indicate code coverage or other quality metrics.
- What text is available is outdated or non-priority.

### Level Two: Bare Minimum README
- Minimal information about what the project is and does, but no details of its purpose.
- Basic installation, configuration, running details for users, but not tested with users and therefore potentially incomplete.
- Basic or no developer documentation.
- A line in the README about contributions, but no dedicated file.
- A line about the project's build status, but possibly outdated or not clear; or no information on this point.
- A line about the average response time to issues and/or pull requests, but possibly outdated or not clear; or no information on this point.
- No badges to indicate code coverage or other quality metrics.
- The text is rarely updated and might be inaccurate.

### Level Three: Basic README
- Somewhat detailed information about what the project is and does, but no details of its purpose.
- Basic installation, configuration, running details for users, tested and complete.
- Developer documentation and references to a vision or project roadmap to onboard new contributors.
- A dedicated Contributing.md/.rst file with basic information.
- A line about the project's build status, but minimal: "under development" or "stable."
- A line about the average response time to issues and/or pull requests.
- At least one badge to indicate code coverage or other quality metrics.
- The text is updated regularly, but at intervals (monthly or quarterly) such that inaccuracies may exist.

### Level Four: README with purpose
- Detailed information about what the project is and does, along with notes about its features/special attributes and why those exist.
- Basic installation, configuration, running details for users are tested, current and complete, and accompanied with information about commonly made errors/how to resolve them.
- Developer documentation and references to a detailed vision or project roadmap to onboard new contributors.
- A dedicated Contributing.md/.rst file with detailed information about style guidelines, caveats, and pull request size.
- Information about the project's build status includes some context about what aspects of the project remain under development and/or are creating instability.
- Clear information about the average response time to issues and/or pull requests.
- One or more badges to indicate code coverage or other quality metrics.
- The text is updated regularly, but at intervals (monthly or quarterly) such that inaccuracies may exist.

### Level Five: Product-oriented README
- Thorough information about what the project is and does, along with details of all its notable features/special attributes and why those exist. The reader will understand why these features and attributes are helpful or meaningful.
- User testimonials and evidence of past performance in real development situations included.
- Basic installation, configuration, running details for users that are tested, current and complete, accompanied with information about commonly made errors/how to resolve them.
- Developer documentation and references to a detailed vision or project roadmap to onboard new contributors; visual aids like diagrams and demos are embedded in the README file.
- A dedicated Contributing.md/.rst file with detailed information about style guidelines, caveats, and pull request size.
- Information about the project's build status includes detailed context about what aspects of the project remain under development and/or are creating instability.
- Clear information about the average response time to issues and/or pull requests.
- One or more badges to indicate code coverage or other quality metrics.
- The text is updated regularly, at frequent intervals (weekly or even daily) such that inaccuracies are unlikely to exist.
