## feedmereadme: A README help exchange

This project originated at FOSDEM '2017 out of a conversation between folks at RedHat and Zalando. The idea is simple:
- If you're a **project author** who's looking for README feedback and help, add the link to your project README via the "Issues" feature on this repository. You can also tweet us your README link at [@twitterfeed TK].
- If you're a **writer or editor** who's interested in helping the open source community but not sure where to start, you can start right here. :) Go to the Issues, find a README to edit, and start working your wordsmith magic. 

### A Note to You Writers: Why Work for Free?
[Some lines about how we understand that writers and editors are often underpaid and undervalued, but why contributing to OSS can still benefit them.]

### For GitHub First-Timers:
If this is your first time using GitHub, [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/) can help you get started. You can also leave a comment in the Issues Tracker; just add "HELP: [your questions/needs]" in your issue.
