## feedmereadme
An exchange for projects to get README help, and writers/editors to give README help

This project originated at FOSDEM '2017 out of a conversation between folks at RedHat and Zalando. The idea is simple:
- If you're a **project author** who's looking for README feedback and help, add the link to your README by filing an issue on this repository. You can also tweet us your README link at [@twitterfeed TK].
- If you're a **writer or editor** who's interested in helping the open source community but not sure where to start, you can start here. :) Go to the Issues, find a README to edit, and start working your wordsmith magic. (If this is your first time using GitHub, [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/) can help you get started. You can also leave a comment in the Issues Tracker; just add "HELP: " in your issue.

### A Note for Writers About Working for Free
Some lines about how we understand that writers and editors are often underpaid and undervalued, but why contributing to OSS can still benefit them.
