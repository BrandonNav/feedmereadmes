## feedmereadme: A README help exchange

This project originated at FOSDEM '2017 out of a conversation between folks at RedHat and Zalando. The idea is simple:
- If you're a **project author** who's looking for README feedback and help, add the link to your project README via the "Issues" feature on this repository. You can also tweet us your README link at [@twitterfeed TK].
- If you're a **writer or editor** who's interested in helping the open source community but not sure where to start, you can start right here. :) Go to the Issues, find a README to edit, and start working your wordsmith magic. 

### Why We're Doing This

In 2010, GitHub founder Tom Preston-Warner wrote ["Readme Driven Development"](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) in which he advocated writing your README first. "First. As in, before you write any code or tests or behaviors or stories or ANYTHING," he wrote. "I know, I know, we’re programmers, dammit, not tech writers! But that’s where you’re wrong. Writing a Readme is absolutely essential to writing good software. Until you’ve written about your software, you have no idea what you’ll be coding."

Years later, documentation remains an overlooked part of OSS development for many. How this plays out:
 - READMEs that come without basic install/run/config instructions, creating needless friction for potential users and contributors.
 - READMEs that don't explain the "Why" and "How" behind the project—why it exists, why it's different from similar projects, how it's used in production by the creators or others, and how it's architected.
 - READMEs that are either too short or too cluttered.
 
Taking a Readme-driven development approach can resolve some of these issues immediately. But even if you don't support Preston-Warner's argument, you can still make sure your Readme makes sense to others. We're here to help you, by connecting you to an audience of OSS enthusiasts and writing/editing professionals willing to offer you feedback and direction.

### A Note to Writers: Why Work for Free?
